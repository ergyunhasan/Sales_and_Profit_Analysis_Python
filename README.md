### Recommendations

The overall trend for both sales and profit is positive, which is a good sign for the company. However, the company should monitor the sales and profit trends for each month to identify any patterns or changes that need to be addressed.

The company should focus on the top-selling products and categories to maximize their profits. The technology category is the most important category for both sales and profits, so the company should invest in promoting and selling more technology products. Phones are the most important sub-category for both sales and profits, so the company should focus on improving sales and profits for this sub-category.

The most selling products and sub-categories should be monitored closely. Staples, Cardinal Index Tab, and Eldon File Cart are the most selling products, and Binders and Storage are the best selling sub-categories. The company should ensure that they maintain a sufficient inventory of these products and sub-categories to meet the customer demand.

The company should focus on improving the profitability of the Furniture category, which is currently the least profitable category. They can achieve this by identifying the reasons for the low profitability and taking corrective actions.

The company should continue to monitor the profitability of the Copiers and Phones sub-categories, which are the most profitable sub-categories. They can focus on promoting and selling more products in these sub-categories to maximize their profits.

The company could also review their shipping and delivery strategies, to ensure that the most preferred shipping mode (Standard Class) is optimized to improve customer satisfaction and minimize shipping costs.

There is an overall upward trend in sales and profit, the company could continue to focus on expanding their sales channels and targeting potential customers in the high performing regions, such as APAC, EU and US.
